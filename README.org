"Masks sometimes turn those who wear them into beasts."


This game will be a belt-scrolling action game based on the story of
“a snowy village where players strip fur from people wearing cursed pelts, freeing them from their grudges.”

We are also considering allowing players to equip the stolen furs themselves to alter their characteristics and gain an advantage in gameplay.
